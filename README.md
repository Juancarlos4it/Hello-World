# Hello-World
This is my first Project with FreeCodeCamp (FCC).

Hi FCC, I am exciting to begin this adventure learning process. To me it's important to keep up
with technology and Coding. 

Coding is an amazing way to express yourself and to be created at the same time. Our brain even 
though its functions are the same in any human being, but we think, express, and perceive the 
world in so differents outlook.

Thank you for priceless effort FCC
